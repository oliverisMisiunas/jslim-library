# Toggle on click

Apply the `jtoggle` class to an element, then, apply the class name that you want to toggle on click.

The class name, that will be toggled, has to be applied to the same element but has to start with the letter `j`. For example, if you want to toggle the class name `container`, you would need to write `jcontainer`.

## Usage

```html
<h1 class="jtoggle jred">click me :)</h1>
```
