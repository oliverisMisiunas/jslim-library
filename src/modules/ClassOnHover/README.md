# Add class on hover

Apply the `jhover` class to an element, then, apply the class name that you want to add on mouse hover. It will be removed automatically when the mouse leaves the object.

The class name, that will be added, has to be applied to the same element but has to start with the letter `j`. For example, if you want to add the class name `container`, you would need to write `jcontainer`

## Usage

```html
<h1 class="jhover jteal">hover on me :)</h1>
```
