# Add on click

Apply the jadd class to an element, then, apply the class name that you want to add on click

The class name, that will be added, has to be applied to the same element but has to start with the letter `j`. For example, if you want to add the class name `container`, you would need to write `jcontainer`

## Usage

```html
<h1 class="jadd jblue"> click me :)</h1>
```
